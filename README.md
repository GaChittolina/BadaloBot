# BadaloBot
BadaloBot is a Discord bot that helps keep channels clean while also serving as a Music Bot. It deletes his and other bots messages and the messages that invoked them 1 minute after they were sent. BadaloBot was written in DiscordJS, an easy-to-use and intuitive JavaScript API for Discord. The Music Bot part of Badalo Bot uses discord.js-music with some tweaks.
