# BadaloBot
BadaloBot is a Discord bot that helps keep channels clean while also serving as a Music Bot.

It deletes his and other bots messages and the messages that invoked them 1 minute after they were sent.

BadaloBot was written in DiscordJS, an easy-to-use and intuitive JavaScript API for Discord.

The Music Bot part of Badalo Bot uses discord.js-music with some tweaks.

Badalo Bot can be added to your channel here: [Invite me!](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=378358281858580490&scope=bot&permissions=8192)

It's hosted at [Glitch](https://glitch.com) and uses [UpTimeRobot](https://uptimerobot.com/) to stay online 24/7!
